Well...
we love the characters.
- But?
- It's a terrific story.
- And?
- And the...
- The dialogue is great.
- Paul.
I just wanna make sure
you give them your best.
Oh, my God.
Look, don't get me wrong.
We do think it has
a lot of potential.
Did you even read it?
Of course I read it, Anna.
Calm down.
I am calm, but this is the third time
you're telling me to rewrite my draft.
I mean, how am I even supposed
to meet the deadline, Paul?
Just take a look at the notes.
I'm sure it's an easy fix for
you.
Yeah, that's what you said
last time.
Why not let the studio decide
if they like it or not?
Because you only get
one shot at this.
Listen, Anna.
This is me managing you.
I'm not trying to piss you off,
but it's not like one of your blogs
where people can look at photographs
when they get bored
of the writing.
Well, that got your attention,
didn't it?
I just don't want you to be one
of those writers who screws up
before anybody's even read
their script.
I've got you this chance,
now use it.
I've been experiencing
sleep paralysis
since I was a little kid.
Like my mind is awake.
I can see and hear and feel,
but I can't move
any part of my body.
It's terrifying.
It's me.
I don't like flowers.
You should know that.
Yeah, well, it's the effort
that counts, though, isn't it?
Do you have any idea
what time it is?
It's never too late
for an apology, is it?
I just wanted to say sorry
for this afternoon.
I think I was
a bit rough on you.
I just don't want you to waste your
first opportunity, that's all.
No, thanks.
Really?
It's not like you to turn down
a glass of wine.
I just had an Ambien.
Still popping the pills, then?
- I thought you came for an apology.
- I did, but...
Well, then stop talking and come
to bed before I fall asleep.
Oh, I meant
to tell you that I, um...
I managed to buy you
a little bit of extra time.
They agreed to postpone
the deadline on the script.
So I was thinking maybe we should
get out of the city for a few days.
You know, just relax.
Get some good sleep.
Forget about the draft.
You know,
take the heat off a little bit.
It'll be inspiring.
Remember I told you I have that
little hideaway out in Joshua Tree?
So around me is utter
devastation with dead bodies
floating down the street
and buildings collapsing.
And I have nothing better to do
but to go downstairs
and underwear shop with Prince
at what has turned into a Black
Friday sales event at Wal-Mart.
Yeah.
Yeah, I started writing down
my dreams again.
A better dream memory is supposed
to help against nightmares.
Wow.
My therapist would make
a fortune out of you.
Found some croutons
in the cupboard.
I hope they're not expired.
- Man, this place is gorgeous.
- Yeah.
How come you've never
taken me here before?
It's been rented for the past
year and a half or so.
Do you think you're gonna be
able to relax while you're here?
I don't know,
but I think that's up to you.
- I'll do my best.
- Mmm.
Ugh.
Oh, fuck!
Oh, shit.
Got you, you little fucker.
Come on, boy.
Huh.
So I leave you for five minutes
and you've destroyed my kitchen.
I just, uh, fixed
the garbage disposal.
Yeah, you don't wanna
touch that thing.
It's a fucking death trap.
What's the matter?
Nothing.
Listen, I, uh...
I got a call from the office.
You get reception?
Yeah, about a mile down
there's a hillside.
You get a few bars up there.
Yeah, anyway, they called
and said they've had to put
an emergency meeting together
about one of my clients.
Apparently I'm the only guy
who can...
Who can talk to him, so...
Well, just tell them
you're already with a client.
Anna, I...
So we have to go?
When?
Kinda now.
Look, I'm really sorry.
I wouldn't do this
if it wasn't an emergency,
but I've tried him
and he's not picking up.
- And there's no...
- No, it's... it's fine. I understand.
Oh, come on, baby.
Come on.
I'll make it up to you.
We can come back again
in a few days if you'd like.
Well, if that's the case,
why don't I just stay here?
Well, 'cause I'm taking the car.
- And you'd be here by yourself.
- Yeah, but it's fine.
I mean, didn't we just buy
enough food for a week?
Well, yeah, but...
And maybe if I'm left alone,
I can get a little writing done.
I'm not a little girl, Paul.
All right.
I'll just do a little checklist
of things you need to know
about the house and I'll
leave him for protection.
Protection from what?
- You never know.
- Oh.
No, he's good company.
Sure, why not?
Well, it's just me and you now,
Shadow.
And my laptop.
All right, fuck it.
Hey, buddy.
Ready to go for a hike?
Yeah?
All right, let's do this.
Hey, buddy.
How you doing?
Come on, Shadow.
Shadow, come on!
Shadow, come!
- Hey!
- Oh!
I'm sorry.
- What are you doing here?
- I was just out on a hike.
You're out on a hike, huh?
Look, are you some sort
of park ranger?
No, I'm not a park ranger,
but this is my home.
I live here.
I stay right over there.
Did you come
from the glass house?
Yeah.
Is there something wrong?
No. No, there's nothing
wrong at all.
I just used to, uh...
I worked for the owner.
- Paul.
- Mm-hmm.
What did you say your name was?
Anna.
I guess we're neighbors, then.
Yeah.
Well, um, it's nice to meet you.
Let's go, Shadow.
Come on.
Shadow, come on.
Oh, God.
Oh, finally!
This is Paul Wagner.
I can't get to the phone right now.
Please leave a message...
Ford and Willis Agency.
- How may I connect your call?
- Paul Wagner.
Mr. Wagner is in a meeting.
Would you like to leave a message?
No, Emily. It's Anna, all right?
This is an emergency.
Can you get him
on the phone right now?
Hello, Ms. Parker.
I'm afraid Mr. Wagner
- cannot take your call right now.
- No, Emily!
You don't understand, okay.
It's an emergency!
I need you to get him
on the phone right now.
I'm just gonna keep calling back
until you get him on.
- One moment, please.
- Thank you.
Anna.
Oh, thank God.
What's up?
The house isn't safe, Paul.
What do you mean
the house isn't safe?
- Has somebody broken in?
- No, I...
I don't know, all right?
Somebody's been there.
- Did you call the police?
- No, I... I wanted to call you first.
When are you coming back?
I don't...
I don't know yet.
We've got another meeting tomorrow
which could take a while.
- Is everything okay?
- No, I'm not all right, Paul.
All right? I'm freaking freezing
and I'm standing on a mountain
in the middle of nowhere!
All right, just calm down.
Tell me exactly what happened.
I don't know,
but the power went out
and this morning when I woke up,
there were all these numbers
written all over the glass.
Are you sure it wasn't
just a bad dream?
No, Paul, please!
You don't understand, all right?
This is different!
I can show you when you get here.
Look, Anna, it's gonna take me
all night to get there.
If you call the police,
they'll be there much faster.
No, I don't want the police.
Do you get it, all right?
This place freaks me the fuck out!
I wanna get out of here!
Okay.
Okay, just calm down.
I'll tell them to push my schedule.
I'll be there as soon as I can.
Just lock yourself in the house and
everything will be fine, all right?
Fine.
Shit.
Oh, great.
Shit!
Shit!
Oh.
Good boy.
Good boy.
Yeah.
You're lucky you had the dog.
It was because of his persistent
barking last night
that I even bothered
to come over.
How's your head?
You must have a hell of a headache.
How did you get in here?
Well, that would be your keys.
- Give me those.
- Uh-uh.
- Give me my fucking keys.
- Easy!
Oh, what are you gonna do
with that?
I swear to God, if you don't
give me my fucking keys,
I'm gonna beat the shit
out of you!
Okay. All right.
Take your keys.
- Nobody's threatening you.
- Bullshit!
You... you knocked me out
and you dragged me here to...
- To do what?
- I don't know.
I saw you running around
last night.
You recognized me,
you tripped over a rock,
you cracked your own head.
And the stuff on the wall, you...
You put it there, didn't you?
What the hell are you talking
about?
Any idea what it means?
Come out here.
Take a look at this.
These are all the same.
3-0-2-12.
It's a date.
March 2nd, 2012.
What?
Who did this?
I thought you did.
Why would I do this?
I don't know.
I mean, you're the only one out here.
- I just assumed.
- I gotta go.
- What does it mean?
- I don't know.
- Yes, you do.
- I don't know.
Okay, wait, just...
Look, you don't have to talk
about it, all right?
Will you just...
Will you just stay until it gets light out?
I don't feel safe here.
Hi.
How you feeling?
What time is it?
3:00 in the afternoon.
You slept quite a while.
What happened to your head?
Did you see the numbers?
What numbers?
In the bedroom on the window.
No, I didn't see any numbers.
I saw the trash bags.
I took them down.
Was it too bright in there for
you?
This is ridiculous.
Anna.
- It was all over the place.
- Listen.
There were no numbers
on the windows.
There were just
a couple of trash bags.
- I took them down, that's all.
- You don't believe me.
No, it's not that
I don't believe you.
I don't know, maybe you had
another nightmare.
It wasn't a nightmare, Paul!
It was a date.
March 2nd, 2012.
- It was all over!
- Look, stop! Anna, please.
This has gone too far now.
Does that date
mean anything to you?
No, it doesn't.
You know what?
Ask your housekeeper or groundskeeper,
whatever he was.
- He was here. He saw it.
- What, Jeremy?
Yeah, I think that's
what his name was.
What was he doing here?
That's what I've been trying
to tell you.
He helped me!
He...
Okay, pack up your things,
get ready to leave.
I'm gonna talk to Jeremy now.
Jeremy.
I saw your little trick
with the graffiti.
You can't hide from me, Jeremy!
You try another stunt like that,
I'll have immigration
send you back to Canada.
Little wanker.
Hey, Anna, are you in there?
Uh, yeah.
Are these bags ready to go now?
Yeah, you can pack 'em.
Oh, listen,
have you seen the key to the boiler room?
- The what?
- The key for the boiler room.
I need to turn the furnace off
before we go.
Wait.
- I haven't seen them.
- Really?
They're not in your jeans
or something?
Hold on a second.
I'll be right there.
All right.
Oh, listen, would you mind
hurrying up a little bit?
I don't wanna get snagged up
in rush hour traffic.
Actually...
- Ah, here they are.
- Why don't we stay?
Paul?
Oh, hey.
Morning.
So why did you sleep
on the couch last night?
Was I that bad in bed?
No, I, uh...
I just couldn't sleep.
Nightmares again?
No, thank God.
All right, I won't be long.
- Okay, I'm gonna go and get gas.
- Okay.
Excuse me.
- More coffee?
- No, thanks.
I'm sorry, this might seem
a bit random,
but do you know this woman?
She built a modern style
glass house out here,
about 10 miles north
of the old Gamma Ranch.
You may want to talk
to Joe over there.
He knows everyone in town.
Thanks.
Excuse me.
I'm sorry to bother you,
but, um,
my name's Anna and I'm looking
for someone from around here.
The bartender said
that you might be able to help.
I'm staying at the glass house.
It's 10 miles north.
You know it?
Yeah, I know that house.
What about it?
I'm looking for the architect,
Vera Palm.
Does that ring any bells?
Let's talk outside.
I know her housekeeper.
- Jeremy?
- Yes.
He comes in for guidance
now and then.
What sort of guidance?
For $39 a session,
you can find out.
I also offer a lot of original
healing stones and native artwork.
My shop is right over there.
I think this has been
a misunderstanding.
Are you sure?
Hey, Anna, you ready?
Look, I'm just trying to find
this woman.
Well, you can't.
She's missing.
Since when?
Last March.
Wait, what happened?
Number's on the card.
Oh, it's freezing in here.
Why don't you take a little nap?
Then when you wake up,
I can grill up some of these
juicy local steaks
I keep hearing about.
You know, I'm really glad
we decided to stay in the end.
Why did you lie to me?
What?
Don't, Paul.
Why did you lie to me?
And there was me thinking we might
have a nice, quiet evening together.
You know what happened
on March 2nd.
- Who have you been talking to now?
- Doesn't matter.
What matters is you didn't tell me
the truth and I wanna know why.
Okay, uh, the truth is
I didn't want to scare you.
It can be pretty intimidating out
here when you're by yourself.
I just didn't wanna fuel
your vivid imagination
with legends about disappearing
people in the desert.
Well, if it's just an urban legend,
then why not tell me?
Because that's what they are.
They're just...
Okay.
The designer of this house,
the architect of this house...
got lost in the desert.
She went for a hike
and never came back.
Apparently it happens all the time.
People get lost.
But she didn't come back.
And you're saying
you didn't know her.
Well, how would I?
I don't believe you.
Anna.
I'm getting worried
about you now, Anna.
It's... it's somewhere down here.
Well, I guess you cleaned it
out.
The photograph?
Yes, I did.
Because you didn't want me
to see her with you.
Of course I didn't want you
to see me with my ex.
I wouldn't want to see photographs of
you lying around with your ex either.
You're hiding something from me.
And don't just keep blaming it
on my vivid imagination.
Oh, really, Anna?
Because considering your history
of mental illness...
Nightmares are not
a mental illness, Paul!
Well...
judging by the amount
of medication you're tak...
I know what I've seen.
I made a terrible mistake.
What?
You're right about one thing.
I've been hiding
something from you.
I couldn't just watch you
pounding these things down
day after day.
They're placebos.
At least you've been having plenty
of vitamin C the last few days.
You switched out my pills?
Yeah.
That's why you've been having
such extreme reactions.
I'm sorry.
I thought you could...
do without them.
I was wrong.
What are you doing?
Anna.
Don't touch me!
You know, maybe this writing gig's
just a bit too much pressure for you.
I can't stay here tonight.
Oh, God.
- I'm gonna stay in town.
- You serious?
We'll talk tomorrow.
Okay, well, listen.
Take these.
Have a good night's sleep.
Who is it?
It's Anna.
We met this afternoon.
I need to talk to you.
I'm closed.
You can come by again
in the morning.
Are you sure?
These are all handcrafted
from various tribes.
Some from my own family,
in fact.
Some I just picked up
over the years.
Let me know if you're interested
in anything
and I'm sure we could work out
some kind of a discount.
Could we just start the session?
Yeah, of course.
Why don't you, um...
pick one of these stones.
- This one?
- Sure.
Good choice.
Really?
I don't have a free hand
for the drums.
This will work just fine.
Just relax.
Why don't you, uh...
take off your top.
You gotta be kidding me.
Do you want me
to help you or not?
You've gotta
be fucking kidding me.
Now lay down.
Now...
We'll search for the chakra
with the most negative energy.
Whoa.
What was that?
What just happened?
What was that?
Do you ever, uh,
feel a growing pressure
in your chest
when you... when you dream?
A feeling of numbness in your limbs
almost as if you were paralyzed?
How did you know that?
In the native culture,
it's known that spirits can possess
the body when you sleep.
They can capture the soul
and take control of the flesh.
To do what?
It depends what you've done.
But I haven't done anything.
No, I don't know what's happening to me,
all right?
You have to help me.
Please.
The only... only way to fight off
this spirit is to control your dream
and command it to leave.
We'll induce a wake-initiated
lucid dream
and you'll become conscious.
When you reach that state,
I need you to perform
some sort of physical activity
so that your muscles
will echo that movement
in this realm.
Lay down.
Just listen...
and focus.
Listen and focus.
Let yourself sink
deep into the bed.
Let your limbs go numb.
Okay.
Don't fight it.
That's it.
That's good.
You are awake in your dream.
That's good.
You're in a state of pure awareness,
but totally...
...paralyzed.
That's good.
That's good.
Stay in control.
Stay in control!
Stay in control.
Stay in control!
Anna!
Anna!
Oh, my God.
Paul?
Have a good rest?
'Cause I didn't.
Spent the night
worried about you.
Feeling guilty about
swapping out your drugs.
But then I discovered this.
Wednesday.
Thursday. Friday.
Sunday.
Where's Saturday, Anna?
I... I don't know.
That's weird because...
Saturday's the night
you were here by yourself.
Let me show you something.
I couldn't really care less
about the surveillance cameras.
Well, it's not as though anything
really happens around here, is it?
But then Shadow found
something out there.
And I thought to myself...
"What is Jeremy's body doing
buried in my backyard?"
Look...
I'm sure there is some
perfectly rational explanation
for all of this.
And if there is...
you should tell me
before I call the police.
I'm gonna make the call.
You should stay here.
It can get pretty dangerous
outside.
There's nowhere for you
to go anyway.
Come on.
Come here.
All right, you stay here,
Shadow.
All right? Stay.
So what now?
Eh? You're not gonna
go anywhere.
Neither are you.
Well, why would I?
The police will be here
in a minute.
Great, then you can tell them
what happened to Vera Palm.
What?
The blind woman who mysteriously
went missing out on the salt lake.
Who you keep
pretending not to know
although her dog
is standing right over there.
Yeah, he dug this up
out on the salt lake.
So tell me, Paul.
How did she go missing if her
guide dog was out there with her?
Vera was my wife.
She was a very talented,
but, um...
unsuccessful architect.
This house was supposed
to change all of that.
For two years, the only thing she
did was work on this project.
Day in, day out.
She became obsessed
with the place.
And by the time she laid
the foundations...
we were living
completely separate lives.
We were like complete strangers.
She invited me out here to
celebrate when it was completed.
Paul? Are you still there?
But why would I?
I wanted you
to come out and celebrate.
This house had stolen my wife.
I can't believe you're doing this.
Paul?
Paul, are you still there?
On the way home that night...
she fell asleep at the wheel
from sheer exhaustion.
When they found the car,
they said, um...
that she was lucky because...
the Joshua tree she hit stopped
her from going over the cliff.
But a branch came in through
the windscreen and, um...
blinded her.
Then what happened?
I became her scapegoat.
If I didn't already feel guilty,
she made me feel guilty.
She didn't miss a chance
to make me feel her pain.
I really tried,
but I just couldn't imagine...
being her caretaker
for the rest of my life.
So when she started
to get better,
I got her the dog.
And she came to live out here
by herself.
My life was finally
becoming normal again.
And then something fantastic
happened.
I met someone new.
Someone I could
fall in love with again.
Then Vera called me
one day and said...
said she wanted me
to come out here
to discuss something.
It was the best time we'd had
for over a year.
Anyway, by the time
we got to the salt lake,
I realized what it was all
about.
She said she wanted
to move back to Los Angeles,
have another go at our marriage.
It was the last thing
I wanted to hear.
So I told her about us.
She was furious.
She said she would divorce me.
I would lose everything.
All my savings, the house.
She said she would ruin me
if I didn't stay with her.
Who wouldn't side with a blind woman
whose husband had cheated on her?
I couldn't let that happen.
You killed her.
We'd, um...
we'd walked quite a long way
into the salt lake.
And I just, um...
took the dog
and kept on walking.
They never found her body.
This happened on March 2nd.
Yeah.
And Jeremy knew.
He saw me coming home
without Vera.
Started asking some questions.
But an illegal immigrant
is easy to keep quiet.
You have to tell the police,
Paul.
No, I'm not gonna let her
ruin my life.
No, you... you don't understand.
You have to, all right?
It's the only way she'll stop.
What are you talking about?
It was Vera that killed Jeremy and
she's gonna come after you next.
Have you gone completely nuts?
If you don't tell the police,
I will.
Well, be my guest.
I can't wait to see
the expression on their faces
when a... a drug-abusing writer
with a history of mental illness
tells them that my ex-wife's
ghost
is on some kind of revenge
mission.
I'll let you do the talking.
She said she would
ruin me if I didn't stay with her.
Who wouldn't side with a blind woman
whose husband had cheated on her?
Don't let her do this to us.
Don't let her separate us, Anna!
Open the damn door!
Shit.
Stand down!
Officer, thank God
you finally arrived.
You need to drop that rock, sir.
- No, I know this looks a little weird.
- Drop that rock.
Officer!
Please, you have to help me!
Don't listen to him!
I need you to drop the rock, sir.
Right now!
- There's just been a bit of a mis...
- Drop the rock!
Turn and face the window!
Turn and face the window!
Hands behind your head.
Tell your dog to back off!
Oh, fuck.
Shit!
Fuck!
Ma'am?
Are you all right?
Can you move?
Are you okay?
Ma'am?
