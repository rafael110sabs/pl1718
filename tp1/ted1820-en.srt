1
00:00:12,533 --> 00:00:14,165
I'm going to be showing some of the cybercriminals'

2
00:00:14,165 --> 00:00:16,627
latest and nastiest creations.

3
00:00:16,627 --> 00:00:19,535
So basically, please don't go and download

4
00:00:19,535 --> 00:00:22,231
any of the viruses that I show you.

5
00:00:22,231 --> 00:00:25,249
Some of you might be wondering what a cybersecurity specialist looks like,

6
00:00:25,249 --> 00:00:27,418
and I thought I'd give you a quick insight

7
00:00:27,418 --> 00:00:30,096
into my career so far.

8
00:00:30,096 --> 00:00:32,597
It's a pretty accurate description.

9
00:00:32,597 --> 00:00:34,253
This is what someone that specializes

10
00:00:34,253 --> 00:00:36,673
in malware and hacking looks like.

11
00:00:36,673 --> 00:00:40,087
So today, computer viruses and trojans,

12
00:00:40,087 --> 00:00:42,967
designed to do everything from stealing data

13
00:00:42,967 --> 00:00:45,008
to watching you in your webcam

14
00:00:45,008 --> 00:00:47,786
to the theft of billions of dollars.

15
00:00:47,786 --> 00:00:49,981
Some malicious code today goes as far

16
00:00:49,981 --> 00:00:54,124
as targeting power, utilities and infrastructure.

17
00:00:54,124 --> 00:00:56,085
Let me give you a quick snapshot

18
00:00:56,085 --> 00:00:58,699
of what malicious code is capable of today.

19
00:00:58,699 --> 00:01:01,769
Right now, every second, eight new users

20
00:01:01,769 --> 00:01:03,924
are joining the Internet.

21
00:01:03,924 --> 00:01:11,232
Today, we will see 250,000 individual new computer viruses.

22
00:01:11,232 --> 00:01:17,005
We will see 30,000 new infected websites.

23
00:01:17,005 --> 00:01:19,091
And, just to kind of tear down a myth here,

24
00:01:19,091 --> 00:01:21,579
lots of people think that when you get infected

25
00:01:21,579 --> 00:01:25,030
with a computer virus, it's because you went to a porn site.

26
00:01:25,030 --> 00:01:27,473
Right? Well, actually, statistically speaking,

27
00:01:27,473 --> 00:01:30,598
if you only visit porn sites, you're safer.

28
00:01:30,598 --> 00:01:33,600
People normally write that down, by the way. (Laughter)

29
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:35,162
Actually, about 80 percent of these

30
00:01:35,162 --> 00:01:38,675
are small business websites getting infected.

31
00:01:38,675 --> 00:01:40,960
Today's cybercriminal, what do they look like?

32
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:43,386
Well, many of you have the image, don't you,

33
00:01:43,386 --> 00:01:45,562
of the spotty teenager sitting in a basement,

34
00:01:45,562 --> 00:01:47,950
hacking away for notoriety.

35
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:49,573
But actually today, cybercriminals

36
00:01:49,573 --> 00:01:52,884
are wonderfully professional and organized.

37
00:01:52,884 --> 00:01:55,755
In fact, they have product adverts.

38
00:01:55,755 --> 00:01:57,886
You can go online and buy a hacking service

39
00:01:57,886 --> 00:02:00,035
to knock your business competitor offline.

40
00:02:00,035 --> 00:02:01,594
Check out this one I found.

41
00:02:01,594 --> 00:02:03,413
(Video) Man: So you're here for one reason,

42
00:02:03,413 --> 00:02:04,878
and that reason is

43
00:02:04,878 --> 00:02:06,790
because you need your business competitors,

44
00:02:06,790 --> 00:02:10,742
rivals, haters, or whatever the reason is, or who,

45
00:02:10,742 --> 00:02:12,486
they are to go down.

46
00:02:12,486 --> 00:02:15,346
Well you, my friend, you've came to the right place.

47
00:02:15,346 --> 00:02:17,762
If you want your business competitors to go down,

48
00:02:17,762 --> 00:02:19,098
well, they can.

49
00:02:19,098 --> 00:02:22,522
If you want your rivals to go offline, well, they will.

50
00:02:22,522 --> 00:02:25,549
Not only that, we are providing a short-term-to-long-term

51
00:02:25,549 --> 00:02:27,904
DDOS service or scheduled attack,

52
00:02:27,904 --> 00:02:31,715
starting five dollars per hour for small personal websites

53
00:02:31,715 --> 00:02:34,619
to 10 to 50 dollars per hour.

54
00:02:34,619 --> 00:02:35,942
James Lyne: Now, I did actually pay

55
00:02:35,942 --> 00:02:38,735
one of these cybercriminals to attack my own website.

56
00:02:38,735 --> 00:02:42,229
Things got a bit tricky when I tried to expense it at the company.

57
00:02:42,229 --> 00:02:43,943
Turns out that's not cool.

58
00:02:43,943 --> 00:02:46,953
But regardless, it's amazing how many products

59
00:02:46,953 --> 00:02:50,065
and services are available now to cybercriminals.

60
00:02:50,065 --> 00:02:52,541
For example, this testing platform,

61
00:02:52,541 --> 00:02:54,256
which enables the cybercriminals

62
00:02:54,256 --> 00:02:56,738
to test the quality of their viruses

63
00:02:56,738 --> 00:02:59,190
before they release them on the world.

64
00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:01,147
For a small fee, they can upload it

65
00:03:01,147 --> 00:03:02,813
and make sure everything is good.

66
00:03:02,813 --> 00:03:04,346
But it goes further.

67
00:03:04,346 --> 00:03:06,591
Cybercriminals now have crime packs

68
00:03:06,591 --> 00:03:09,710
with business intelligence reporting dashboards

69
00:03:09,710 --> 00:03:13,186
to manage the distribution of their malicious code.

70
00:03:13,186 --> 00:03:16,714
This is the market leader in malware distribution,

71
00:03:16,714 --> 00:03:18,352
the Black Hole Exploit Pack,

72
00:03:18,352 --> 00:03:22,011
responsible for nearly one third of malware distribution

73
00:03:22,011 --> 00:03:23,985
in the last couple of quarters.

74
00:03:23,985 --> 00:03:26,994
It comes with technical installation guides,

75
00:03:26,994 --> 00:03:28,039
video setup routines,

76
00:03:28,039 --> 00:03:31,994
and get this, technical support.

77
00:03:31,994 --> 00:03:34,382
You can email the cybercriminals and they'll tell you

78
00:03:34,382 --> 00:03:38,004
how to set up your illegal hacking server.

79
00:03:38,004 --> 00:03:42,288
So let me show you what malicious code looks like today.

80
00:03:42,288 --> 00:03:44,600
What I've got here is two systems,

81
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:48,290
an attacker, which I've made look all Matrix-y and scary,

82
00:03:48,290 --> 00:03:51,592
and a victim, which you might recognize from home or work.

83
00:03:51,592 --> 00:03:54,321
Now normally, these would be on different sides

84
00:03:54,321 --> 00:03:56,876
of the planet or of the Internet,

85
00:03:56,876 --> 00:03:58,272
but I've put them side by side

86
00:03:58,272 --> 00:04:00,936
because it makes things much more interesting.

87
00:04:00,936 --> 00:04:02,991
Now, there are many ways you can get infected.

88
00:04:02,991 --> 00:04:05,583
You will have come in contact with some of them.

89
00:04:05,583 --> 00:04:07,679
Maybe some of you have received an email

90
00:04:07,679 --> 00:04:11,764
that says something like, "Hi, I'm a Nigerian banker,

91
00:04:11,764 --> 00:04:14,528
and I'd like to give you 53 billion dollars

92
00:04:14,528 --> 00:04:16,955
because I like your face."

93
00:04:16,955 --> 00:04:20,349
Or funnycats.exe, which rumor has it

94
00:04:20,349 --> 00:04:24,118
was quite successful in China's recent campaign against America.

95
00:04:24,118 --> 00:04:26,548
Now there are many ways you can get infected.

96
00:04:26,548 --> 00:04:28,535
I want to show you a couple of my favorites.

97
00:04:28,535 --> 00:04:31,195
This is a little USB key.

98
00:04:31,195 --> 00:04:33,352
Now how do you get a USB key to run in a business?

99
00:04:33,352 --> 00:04:37,477
Well, you could try looking really cute.

100
00:04:37,477 --> 00:04:39,415
Awww.

101
00:04:39,415 --> 00:04:41,778
Or, in my case, awkward and pathetic.

102
00:04:41,778 --> 00:04:45,967
So imagine this scenario: I walk into one of your businesses,

103
00:04:45,967 --> 00:04:48,809
looking very awkward and pathetic, with a copy of my C.V.

104
00:04:48,809 --> 00:04:50,708
which I've covered in coffee,

105
00:04:50,708 --> 00:04:54,095
and I ask the receptionist to plug in this USB key

106
00:04:54,095 --> 00:04:56,044
and print me a new one.

107
00:04:56,044 --> 00:04:59,274
So let's have a look here on my victim computer.

108
00:04:59,274 --> 00:05:02,520
What I'm going to do is plug in the USB key.

109
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:04,010
After a couple of seconds,

110
00:05:04,010 --> 00:05:06,761
things start to happen on the computer on their own,

111
00:05:06,761 --> 00:05:08,696
usually a bad sign.

112
00:05:08,696 --> 00:05:10,390
This would, of course, normally happen

113
00:05:10,390 --> 00:05:13,148
in a couple of seconds, really, really quickly,

114
00:05:13,148 --> 00:05:14,808
but I've kind of slowed it down

115
00:05:14,808 --> 00:05:17,638
so you can actually see the attack occurring.

116
00:05:17,638 --> 00:05:20,155
Malware is very boring otherwise.

117
00:05:20,155 --> 00:05:22,752
So this is writing out the malicious code,

118
00:05:22,752 --> 00:05:26,549
and a few seconds later, on the left-hand side,

119
00:05:26,549 --> 00:05:30,847
you'll see the attacker's screen get some interesting new text.

120
00:05:30,847 --> 00:05:32,778
Now if I place the mouse cursor over it,

121
00:05:32,778 --> 00:05:35,085
this is what we call a command prompt,

122
00:05:35,085 --> 00:05:38,882
and using this we can navigate around the computer.

123
00:05:38,882 --> 00:05:41,041
We can access your documents, your data.

124
00:05:41,041 --> 00:05:42,542
You can turn on the webcam.

125
00:05:42,542 --> 00:05:44,171
That can be very embarrassing.

126
00:05:44,171 --> 00:05:45,894
Or just to really prove a point,

127
00:05:45,894 --> 00:05:49,015
we can launch programs like my personal favorite,

128
00:05:49,015 --> 00:05:51,820
the Windows Calculator.

129
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:54,108
So isn't it amazing how much control

130
00:05:54,108 --> 00:05:57,003
the attackers can get with such a simple operation?

131
00:05:57,003 --> 00:05:58,934
Let me show you how most malware

132
00:05:58,934 --> 00:06:01,117
is now distributed today.

133
00:06:01,117 --> 00:06:03,637
What I'm going to do is open up a website

134
00:06:03,637 --> 00:06:04,953
that I wrote.

135
00:06:04,953 --> 00:06:09,268
It's a terrible website. It's got really awful graphics.

136
00:06:09,268 --> 00:06:11,462
And it's got a comments section here

137
00:06:11,462 --> 00:06:15,143
where we can submit comments to the website.

138
00:06:15,143 --> 00:06:18,150
Many of you will have used something a bit like this before.

139
00:06:18,150 --> 00:06:20,097
Unfortunately, when this was implemented,

140
00:06:20,097 --> 00:06:22,522
the developer was slightly inebriated

141
00:06:22,522 --> 00:06:23,764
and managed to forget

142
00:06:23,764 --> 00:06:26,753
all of the secure coding practices he had learned.

143
00:06:26,753 --> 00:06:29,819
So let's imagine that our attacker,

144
00:06:29,819 --> 00:06:33,267
called Evil Hacker just for comedy value,

145
00:06:33,267 --> 00:06:35,290
inserts something a little nasty.

146
00:06:35,290 --> 00:06:36,989
This is a script.

147
00:06:36,989 --> 00:06:41,066
It's code which will be interpreted on the webpage.

148
00:06:41,066 --> 00:06:43,391
So I'm going to submit this post,

149
00:06:43,391 --> 00:06:45,773
and then, on my victim computer,

150
00:06:45,773 --> 00:06:47,800
I'm going to open up the web browser

151
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:50,053
and browse to my website,

152
00:06:50,053 --> 00:06:53,842
www.incrediblyhacked.com.

153
00:06:53,842 --> 00:06:55,966
Notice that after a couple of seconds,

154
00:06:55,966 --> 00:06:57,423
I get redirected.

155
00:06:57,423 --> 00:06:59,400
That website address at the top there,

156
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:02,731
which you can just about see, microshaft.com,

157
00:07:02,731 --> 00:07:05,924
the browser crashes as it hits one of these exploit packs,

158
00:07:05,924 --> 00:07:09,948
and up pops fake antivirus.

159
00:07:09,948 --> 00:07:15,004
This is a virus pretending to look like antivirus software,

160
00:07:15,004 --> 00:07:17,369
and it will go through and it will scan the system,

161
00:07:17,369 --> 00:07:18,877
have a look at what its popping up here.

162
00:07:18,877 --> 00:07:20,625
It creates some very serious alerts.

163
00:07:20,625 --> 00:07:22,968
Oh look, a child porn proxy server.

164
00:07:22,968 --> 00:07:25,400
We really should clean that up.

165
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:26,984
What's really insulting about this is

166
00:07:26,984 --> 00:07:31,222
not only does it provide the attackers with access to your data,

167
00:07:31,222 --> 00:07:34,045
but when the scan finishes, they tell you

168
00:07:34,045 --> 00:07:37,168
in order to clean up the fake viruses,

169
00:07:37,168 --> 00:07:39,844
you have to register the product.

170
00:07:39,844 --> 00:07:43,180
Now I liked it better when viruses were free.

171
00:07:43,180 --> 00:07:45,959
(Laughter)

172
00:07:45,959 --> 00:07:48,485
People now pay cybercriminals money

173
00:07:48,485 --> 00:07:50,586
to run viruses,

174
00:07:50,586 --> 00:07:53,347
which I find utterly bizarre.

175
00:07:53,347 --> 00:07:56,883
So anyway, let me change pace a little bit.

176
00:07:56,883 --> 00:08:00,389
Chasing 250,000 pieces of malware a day

177
00:08:00,389 --> 00:08:02,044
is a massive challenge,

178
00:08:02,044 --> 00:08:04,114
and those numbers are only growing

179
00:08:04,114 --> 00:08:07,993
directly in proportion to the length of my stress line, you'll note here.

180
00:08:07,993 --> 00:08:09,869
So I want to talk to you briefly

181
00:08:09,869 --> 00:08:12,919
about a group of hackers we tracked for a year

182
00:08:12,919 --> 00:08:14,926
and actually found --

183
00:08:14,926 --> 00:08:17,503
and this is a rare treat in our job.

184
00:08:17,503 --> 00:08:19,986
Now this was a cross-industry collaboration,

185
00:08:19,986 --> 00:08:22,375
people from Facebook, independent researchers,

186
00:08:22,375 --> 00:08:24,456
guys from Sophos.

187
00:08:24,456 --> 00:08:27,111
So here we have a couple of documents

188
00:08:27,111 --> 00:08:29,937
which our cybercriminals had uploaded

189
00:08:29,937 --> 00:08:34,314
to a cloud service, kind of like Dropbox or SkyDrive,

190
00:08:34,314 --> 00:08:36,523
like many of you might use.

191
00:08:36,523 --> 00:08:39,915
At the top, you'll notice a section of source code.

192
00:08:39,915 --> 00:08:42,883
What this would do is send the cybercriminals

193
00:08:42,883 --> 00:08:47,923
a text message every day telling them how much money

194
00:08:47,923 --> 00:08:49,589
they'd made that day,

195
00:08:49,589 --> 00:08:52,885
so a kind of cybercriminal billings report, if you will.

196
00:08:52,885 --> 00:08:55,642
If you look closely, you'll notice a series

197
00:08:55,642 --> 00:08:58,625
of what are Russian telephone numbers.

198
00:08:58,625 --> 00:09:00,104
Now that's obviously interesting,

199
00:09:00,104 --> 00:09:03,341
because that gives us a way of finding our cybercriminals.

200
00:09:03,341 --> 00:09:05,456
Down below, highlighted in red,

201
00:09:05,456 --> 00:09:07,207
in the other section of source code,

202
00:09:07,207 --> 00:09:09,950
is this bit "leded:leded."

203
00:09:09,950 --> 00:09:11,239
That's a username,

204
00:09:11,239 --> 00:09:14,098
kind of like you might have on Twitter.

205
00:09:14,098 --> 00:09:15,329
So let's take this a little further.

206
00:09:15,329 --> 00:09:17,587
There are a few other interesting pieces

207
00:09:17,587 --> 00:09:19,862
the cybercriminals had uploaded.

208
00:09:19,862 --> 00:09:22,434
Lots of you here will use smartphones

209
00:09:22,434 --> 00:09:25,081
to take photos and post them from the conference.

210
00:09:25,081 --> 00:09:27,918
An interesting feature of lots of modern smartphones

211
00:09:27,918 --> 00:09:29,585
is that when you take a photo,

212
00:09:29,585 --> 00:09:33,822
it embeds GPS data about where that photo was taken.

213
00:09:33,822 --> 00:09:36,265
In fact, I've been spending a lot of time

214
00:09:36,265 --> 00:09:38,509
on Internet dating sites recently,

215
00:09:38,509 --> 00:09:40,920
obviously for research purposes,

216
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:44,441
and I've noticed that about 60 percent

217
00:09:44,441 --> 00:09:47,264
of the profile pictures on Internet dating sites

218
00:09:47,264 --> 00:09:51,715
contain the GPS coordinates of where the photo was taken,

219
00:09:51,715 --> 00:09:52,776
which is kind of scary

220
00:09:52,776 --> 00:09:55,338
because you wouldn't give out your home address

221
00:09:55,338 --> 00:09:56,787
to lots of strangers,

222
00:09:56,787 --> 00:09:58,781
but we're happy to give away our GPS coordinates

223
00:09:58,781 --> 00:10:02,810
to plus or minus 15 meters.

224
00:10:02,810 --> 00:10:06,044
And our cybercriminals had done the same thing.

225
00:10:06,044 --> 00:10:09,248
So here's a photo which resolves to St. Petersburg.

226
00:10:09,248 --> 00:10:12,934
We then deploy the incredibly advanced hacking tool.

227
00:10:12,934 --> 00:10:15,329
We used Google.

228
00:10:15,329 --> 00:10:17,554
Using the email address, the telephone number

229
00:10:17,554 --> 00:10:21,103
and the GPS data, on the left you see an advert

230
00:10:21,103 --> 00:10:24,772
for a BMW that one of our cybercriminals is selling,

231
00:10:24,772 --> 00:10:30,120
on the other side an advert for the sale of sphynx kittens.

232
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:33,220
One of these was more stereotypical for me.

233
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:37,209
A little more searching, and here's our cybercriminal.

234
00:10:37,209 --> 00:10:40,755
Imagine, these are hardened cybercriminals

235
00:10:40,755 --> 00:10:42,623
sharing information scarcely.

236
00:10:42,623 --> 00:10:43,771
Imagine what you could find

237
00:10:43,771 --> 00:10:45,474
about each of the people in this room.

238
00:10:45,474 --> 00:10:47,280
A bit more searching through the profile

239
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:49,140
and there's a photo of their office.

240
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:51,188
They were working on the third floor.

241
00:10:51,188 --> 00:10:53,387
And you can also see some photos

242
00:10:53,387 --> 00:10:54,562
from his business companion

243
00:10:54,562 --> 00:10:59,401
where he has a taste in a certain kind of image.

244
00:10:59,401 --> 00:11:03,396
It turns out he's a member of the Russian Adult Webmasters Federation.

245
00:11:03,396 --> 00:11:06,413
But this is where our investigation starts to slow down.

246
00:11:06,413 --> 00:11:10,356
The cybercriminals have locked down their profiles quite well.

247
00:11:10,356 --> 00:11:12,391
And herein is the greatest lesson

248
00:11:12,391 --> 00:11:16,969
of social media and mobile devices for all of us right now.

249
00:11:16,969 --> 00:11:20,699
Our friends, our families and our colleagues

250
00:11:20,699 --> 00:11:25,388
can break our security even when we do the right things.

251
00:11:25,388 --> 00:11:28,168
This is MobSoft, one of the companies

252
00:11:28,168 --> 00:11:30,334
that this cybercriminal gang owned,

253
00:11:30,334 --> 00:11:31,923
and an interesting thing about MobSoft

254
00:11:31,923 --> 00:11:34,794
is the 50-percent owner of this

255
00:11:34,794 --> 00:11:36,741
posted a job advert,

256
00:11:36,741 --> 00:11:40,121
and this job advert matched one of the telephone numbers

257
00:11:40,121 --> 00:11:42,273
from the code earlier.

258
00:11:42,273 --> 00:11:44,398
This woman was Maria,

259
00:11:44,398 --> 00:11:47,278
and Maria is the wife of one of our cybercriminals.

260
00:11:47,278 --> 00:11:50,798
And it's kind of like she went into her social media settings

261
00:11:50,798 --> 00:11:53,593
and clicked on every option imaginable

262
00:11:53,593 --> 00:11:57,290
to make herself really, really insecure.

263
00:11:57,290 --> 00:11:58,857
By the end of the investigation,

264
00:11:58,857 --> 00:12:02,416
where you can read the full 27-page report at that link,

265
00:12:02,416 --> 00:12:04,450
we had photos of the cybercriminals,

266
00:12:04,450 --> 00:12:07,345
even the office Christmas party

267
00:12:07,345 --> 00:12:09,211
when they were out on an outing.

268
00:12:09,211 --> 00:12:12,460
That's right, cybercriminals do have Christmas parties,

269
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:14,048
as it turns out.

270
00:12:14,048 --> 00:12:16,283
Now you're probably wondering what happened to these guys.

271
00:12:16,283 --> 00:12:19,220
Let me come back to that in just a minute.

272
00:12:19,220 --> 00:12:21,967
I want to change pace to one last little demonstration,

273
00:12:21,967 --> 00:12:25,936
a technique that is wonderfully simple and basic,

274
00:12:25,936 --> 00:12:29,001
but is interesting in exposing how much information

275
00:12:29,001 --> 00:12:30,777
we're all giving away,

276
00:12:30,777 --> 00:12:35,055
and it's relevant because it applies to us as a TED audience.

277
00:12:35,055 --> 00:12:37,505
This is normally when people start kind of shuffling in their pockets

278
00:12:37,505 --> 00:12:41,723
trying to turn their phones onto airplane mode desperately.

279
00:12:41,723 --> 00:12:43,409
Many of you all know about the concept

280
00:12:43,409 --> 00:12:45,752
of scanning for wireless networks.

281
00:12:45,752 --> 00:12:49,153
You do it every time you take out your iPhone or your Blackberry

282
00:12:49,153 --> 00:12:53,173
and connect to something like TEDAttendees.

283
00:12:53,173 --> 00:12:54,920
But what you might not know

284
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:59,671
is that you're also beaming out a list of networks

285
00:12:59,671 --> 00:13:02,093
you've previously connected to,

286
00:13:02,093 --> 00:13:06,240
even when you're not using wireless actively.

287
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:07,967
So I ran a little scan.

288
00:13:07,967 --> 00:13:10,893
I was relatively inhibited compared to the cybercriminals,

289
00:13:10,893 --> 00:13:13,437
who wouldn't be so concerned by law,

290
00:13:13,437 --> 00:13:16,024
and here you can see my mobile device.

291
00:13:16,024 --> 00:13:18,678
Okay? So you can see a list of wireless networks.

292
00:13:18,678 --> 00:13:23,305
TEDAttendees, HyattLB. Where do you think I'm staying?

293
00:13:23,305 --> 00:13:26,798
My home network, PrettyFlyForAWifi,

294
00:13:26,798 --> 00:13:28,563
which I think is a great name.

295
00:13:28,563 --> 00:13:31,330
Sophos_Visitors, SANSEMEA, companies I work with.

296
00:13:31,330 --> 00:13:34,638
Loganwifi, that's in Boston. HiltonLondon.

297
00:13:34,638 --> 00:13:37,079
CIASurveillanceVan.

298
00:13:37,079 --> 00:13:38,688
We called it that at one of our conferences

299
00:13:38,688 --> 00:13:40,424
because we thought that would freak people out,

300
00:13:40,424 --> 00:13:42,418
which is quite fun.

301
00:13:42,418 --> 00:13:47,076
This is how geeks party.

302
00:13:47,076 --> 00:13:49,283
So let's make this a little bit more interesting.

303
00:13:49,283 --> 00:13:51,821
Let's talk about you.

304
00:13:51,821 --> 00:13:53,931
Twenty-three percent of you have been to Starbucks

305
00:13:53,931 --> 00:13:57,046
recently and used the wireless network.

306
00:13:57,046 --> 00:13:58,210
Things get more interesting.

307
00:13:58,210 --> 00:14:00,656
Forty-six percent of you I could link to a business,

308
00:14:00,656 --> 00:14:03,526
XYZ Employee network.

309
00:14:03,526 --> 00:14:07,705
This isn't an exact science, but it gets pretty accurate.

310
00:14:07,705 --> 00:14:12,174
Seven hundred and sixty-one of you I could identify a hotel you'd been to recently,

311
00:14:12,174 --> 00:14:16,013
absolutely with pinpoint precision somewhere on the globe.

312
00:14:16,013 --> 00:14:19,961
Two hundred and thirty-four of you, well, I know where you live.

313
00:14:19,961 --> 00:14:22,280
Your wireless network name is so unique

314
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:23,829
that I was able to pinpoint it

315
00:14:23,829 --> 00:14:26,496
using data available openly on the Internet

316
00:14:26,496 --> 00:14:30,744
with no hacking or clever, clever tricks.

317
00:14:30,744 --> 00:14:32,564
And I should mention as well that

318
00:14:32,564 --> 00:14:34,106
some of you do use your names,

319
00:14:34,106 --> 00:14:36,702
"James Lyne's iPhone," for example.

320
00:14:36,702 --> 00:14:41,060
And two percent of you have a tendency to extreme profanity.

321
00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:43,064
So something for you to think about:

322
00:14:43,064 --> 00:14:46,977
As we adopt these new applications and mobile devices,

323
00:14:46,977 --> 00:14:49,294
as we play with these shiny new toys,

324
00:14:49,294 --> 00:14:53,116
how much are we trading off convenience

325
00:14:53,116 --> 00:14:56,006
for privacy and security?

326
00:14:56,006 --> 00:14:58,064
Next time you install something,

327
00:14:58,064 --> 00:15:00,368
look at the settings and ask yourself,

328
00:15:00,368 --> 00:15:03,920
"Is this information that I want to share?

329
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:06,810
Would someone be able to abuse it?"

330
00:15:06,810 --> 00:15:08,882
We also need to think very carefully

331
00:15:08,882 --> 00:15:13,023
about how we develop our future talent pool.

332
00:15:13,023 --> 00:15:16,002
You see, technology's changing at a staggering rate,

333
00:15:16,002 --> 00:15:19,178
and that 250,000 pieces of malware

334
00:15:19,178 --> 00:15:22,050
won't stay the same for long.

335
00:15:22,050 --> 00:15:24,248
There's a very concerning trend

336
00:15:24,248 --> 00:15:27,441
that whilst many people coming out of schools now

337
00:15:27,441 --> 00:15:31,853
are much more technology-savvy, they know how to use technology,

338
00:15:31,853 --> 00:15:35,466
fewer and fewer people are following the feeder subjects

339
00:15:35,466 --> 00:15:39,790
to know how that technology works under the covers.

340
00:15:39,790 --> 00:15:44,175
In the U.K., a 60 percent reduction since 2003,

341
00:15:44,175 --> 00:15:47,950
and there are similar statistics all over the world.

342
00:15:47,950 --> 00:15:52,026
We also need to think about the legal issues in this area.

343
00:15:52,026 --> 00:15:53,553
The cybercriminals I talked about,

344
00:15:53,553 --> 00:15:55,692
despite theft of millions of dollars,

345
00:15:55,692 --> 00:15:57,801
actually still haven't been arrested,

346
00:15:57,801 --> 00:16:01,360
and at this point possibly never will.

347
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:04,860
Most laws are national in their implementation,

348
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:08,859
despite cybercrime conventions, where the Internet

349
00:16:08,859 --> 00:16:11,965
is borderless and international by definition.

350
00:16:11,965 --> 00:16:14,798
Countries do not agree, which makes this area

351
00:16:14,798 --> 00:16:18,415
exceptionally challenging from a legal perspective.

352
00:16:18,415 --> 00:16:22,775
But my biggest ask is this:

353
00:16:22,775 --> 00:16:24,417
You see, you're going to leave here

354
00:16:24,417 --> 00:16:28,134
and you're going to see some astonishing stories in the news.

355
00:16:28,134 --> 00:16:30,308
You're going to read about malware doing incredible

356
00:16:30,308 --> 00:16:33,569
and terrifying, scary things.

357
00:16:33,569 --> 00:16:37,498
However, 99 percent of it works

358
00:16:37,498 --> 00:16:41,688
because people fail to do the basics.

359
00:16:41,688 --> 00:16:44,710
So my ask is this: Go online,

360
00:16:44,710 --> 00:16:47,355
find these simple best practices,

361
00:16:47,355 --> 00:16:49,909
find out how to update and patch your computer.

362
00:16:49,909 --> 00:16:51,460
Get a secure password.

363
00:16:51,460 --> 00:16:52,990
Make sure you use a different password

364
00:16:52,990 --> 00:16:56,341
on each of your sites and services online.

365
00:16:56,341 --> 00:16:59,584
Find these resources. Apply them.

366
00:16:59,584 --> 00:17:02,195
The Internet is a fantastic resource

367
00:17:02,195 --> 00:17:04,260
for business, for political expression,

368
00:17:04,260 --> 00:17:06,591
for art and for learning.

369
00:17:06,591 --> 00:17:09,773
Help me and the security community

370
00:17:09,773 --> 00:17:13,241
make life much, much more difficult

371
00:17:13,241 --> 00:17:15,193
for cybercriminals.

372
00:17:15,193 --> 00:17:16,521
Thank you.

373
00:17:16,521 --> 00:17:21,060
(Applause)
